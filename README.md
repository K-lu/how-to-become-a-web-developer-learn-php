# [How to Become a Web Developer: Learn PHP][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Web development can be confusing at first. There are a number of basic languages and technologies to learn: CSS, HTML, HTTP, and so on. Moreover, applications and sites are often split into two parts: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the user's browser, that's where content is displayed and where styling and interaction happen. However, the back-end is where user data is saved and processed and where web pages are served.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you one of the fundamental languages for back-end web development: PHP. You'll learn how to set up a server on your own computer for development, and how to create a simple PHP application to render a web page. By the end, your app will be able recieve data from the user and respond to it.
